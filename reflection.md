Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
    I decide to overload:
    House: constructor, moveIn()
    Library: constructor, addTitle()
    Cafe: Constructor, restock()
    
    The reason why I choose constructor for all 3 subclasses is because there are more than one parameter in all 3 constructors, which is easier for me to start to work on overloaded methods.

    For the second method to work on, 
    House: moveIn()
    When there is a family of 3 moving in, we can loop over an array list to add all of them at once instead of repeating moveIn() 3 times.

    Library: addTitle()
    Same logic as moveIN(), sometimes we need to add a lot of books into library. Then, we can loop over the array list to add every book in the array list into the library.

    Cafe: restock()
    We can restock whenever we want to. It doesn't necessarily need to be used


- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
